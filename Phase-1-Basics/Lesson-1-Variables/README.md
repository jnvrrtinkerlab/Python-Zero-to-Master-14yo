# Lesson 1: Variables & Print Statements

## What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a box where you can store information. Think of it like a labeled container that holds data.

Example: If you have a box labeled "Name", you can put "Alice" inside it.

## Creating Variables

In Python, creating a variable is super easy:

```python
# This creates a variable called "name" with the value "Alice"
name = "Alice"
age = 14
height = 5.6
```

**How it works:**
- `name` = the variable name (what we call our box)
- `=` = assignment (put something inside the box)
- `"Alice"` = the value (what goes inside)

---

## Variable Rules

✅ Variable names can have letters, numbers, and underscores
✅ Must start with a letter or underscore
✅ Cannot have spaces
❌ Variables are case-sensitive (name ≠ Name)

**Good examples:**
```python
my_name = "Bob"
age_2024 = 14
_secret = "hidden"
```

**Bad examples:**
```python
2name = "Bob"          # Cannot start with number!
my-name = "Bob"        # Cannot use dash!
my name = "Bob"        # Cannot have spaces!
```

## Print Statements

A **print statement** shows information on the screen.

```python
print("Hello World!")
print(12 + 5)
print(name)  # Shows the value inside the name variable
```

---

## Your First Program

```python
# Step 1: Create variables
name = "Your Name"
age = 14
school = "Your School"

# Step 2: Print the variables
print("My name is")
print(name)
print("I am")
print(age)
print("years old")
print("I go to")
print(school)
```

**Output:**
```
My name is
Your Name
I am
14
years old
I go to
Your School
```

## Exercise

Create a Python file called `lesson1.py` with:
1. Three variables: your_name, favorite_color, favorite_food
2. Print each variable on separate lines

Example:
```python
your_name = "Alice"
favorite_color = "Blue"
favorite_food = "Pizza"

print(your_name)
print(favorite_color)
print(favorite_food)
```

## Key Points

✍️ Variables store information
✍️ Use = to assign values
✍️ Variable names follow specific rules
✍️ print() displays information on screen
✍️ One print = one line of output
