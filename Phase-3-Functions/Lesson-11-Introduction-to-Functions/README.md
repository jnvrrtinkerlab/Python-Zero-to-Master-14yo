# Lesson 11: Introduction to Functions

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what functions are and why we use them
- Learn how to define and call functions
- Use function parameters and return values
- Practice writing reusable code blocks

## What Are Functions?

A **function** is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Instead of writing the same code over and over, we can write it once in a function and call it multiple times.

### Real-World Analogy
Think of a function like a recipe:
- **Function definition** = Writing down the recipe
- **Function call** = Following the recipe to make a dish
- **Parameters** = Ingredients you add
- **Return value** = The finished dish

## Function Syntax

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    """Docstring explaining what the function does"""
    # Function body - code to execute
    return value  # Optional: return a result
```

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Function Definition**: Creating a function with `def`
2. **Function Calls**: Using the function by name with ()
3. **Parameters**: Variables that functions receive
4. **Arguments**: Actual values passed to functions
5. **Return Statements**: Sending values back from functions
6. **Docstrings**: Documentation for functions

## Common Use Cases
- Avoiding code repetition
- Organizing code into logical units
- Making code more readable
- Testing specific functionality
- Reusing code across projects

## Challenge
Create your first function that:
1. Takes a parameter
2. Does something with that parameter
3. Returns a result
4. Call it with different values

## Next Steps
- Practice creating simple functions
- Complete all exercises in `exercises.py`
- Understand the difference between parameters and arguments
