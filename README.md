## 💡 Important Tips for Success

### 1. **Type Out Every Line**
Don't copy-paste code. Type it yourself! This helps your brain learn.

### 2. **Experiment & Break Things**
It's okay if your code has errors. That's how you learn! Read the error message and fix it.

### 3. **Use Comments to Explain**
```python
# This is a comment
# Comments help explain your code
print("Code")  # You can also comment on the same line
```

### 4. **Practice Daily**
Even 15 minutes of coding every day is better than 3 hours once a week.

### 5. **Ask for Help**
If stuck, ask:
- Your teacher/tutor
- Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/)
- ChatGPT or Claude for explanations
- The Python community online
