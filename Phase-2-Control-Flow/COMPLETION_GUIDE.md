# Phase 2: Control Flow - Completion Guide

## What Has Been Done

### ✅ Created Code Files
- **Lesson 6 examples.py** - 10 comprehensive If/Else examples (156 lines)
- **Lesson 6 exercises.py** - 10 practice problems with integrated solutions (165 lines)
- **Lesson 7 examples.py** - 10 If/Elif/Else examples covering grades, nested conditions, complex logic (135+ lines)

### ✅ Documentation Files Created
- **IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md** - Progress tracking and current status
- **COMPLETION_GUIDE.md** - This file

### ✅ Files Still Needed (Priority Order)

#### Lesson 6
- [ ] exercises.py (for practice)
- [ ] solutions.py (detailed solutions)
- [ ] Notes.md (quick reference)

#### Lesson 7
- [ ] exercises.py (practice problems)
- [ ] solutions.py (solutions)
- [ ] Notes.md (notes)

#### Lesson 8 (While Loops)
- [ ] examples.py
- [ ] exercises.py
- [ ] solutions.py
- [ ] Notes.md

#### Lesson 9 (For Loops)
- [ ] examples.py
- [ ] exercises.py
- [ ] solutions.py
- [ ] Notes.md

#### Lesson 10 (Break/Continue)
- [ ] examples.py
- [ ] exercises.py
- [ ] solutions.py
- [ ] Notes.md

## How to Continue

### Pattern to Follow
Each lesson (8-10) should have:
1. **examples.py** - 10 runnable examples with real-world scenarios
2. **exercises.py** - 8-10 practice problems with integrated solutions
3. **solutions.py** - Detailed solutions with explanations
4. **Notes.md** - Key concepts summary and tips

### Time Estimates
- Each lesson file: 2-3 hours
- Total remaining: 20-25 hours

### File Templates
Use Lesson 6 & 7 as templates:
- Copy the structure from examples.py
- Maintain same commenting style
- Include real-world applications
- Test all code before committing

## Current Status Summary

**Lesson 6:** 40% complete (2/5 files)
**Lesson 7:** 20% complete (1/5 files)
**Lesson 8:** 20% complete (README only)
**Lesson 9:** 20% complete (README only)
**Lesson 10:** 20% complete (README only)

**Overall:** 24% complete

---

## Known Issues

1. **Folder Structure** - Lesson 6 has nested path issue
   - Current: `Lesson-6-If-Else/Phase-2-Control-Flow/Lesson-06-If-Else/`
   - Should be: `Lesson-6-If-Else/` (direct)

2. **Lesson Numbering** - README has logical operators in Lesson 8, but actual Lesson 8 is While Loops
   - Missing: Dedicated Logical Operators lesson
   - Option: Add to Lesson 7 or create Lesson 8.5

---

## Quality Checklist for New Files

- [ ] All code is runnable without errors
- [ ] Comprehensive comments on every example
- [ ] At least 2 real-world applications per lesson
- [ ] Solutions are integrated or in separate file
- [ ] Difficulty progression is clear
- [ ] Examples cover all learning objectives from README
- [ ] Tested in Python 3.8+

## Next Session Priorities

1. Create Lesson 7 exercises.py (2 hours)
2. Create Lesson 8 examples.py (2-3 hours)
3. Create Lesson 8 exercises.py (2-3 hours)
4. Continue pattern for Lessons 9-10
