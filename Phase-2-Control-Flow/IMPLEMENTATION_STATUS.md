## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Code Files ✅ STARTED
- **Issue:** Students had no runnable examples or practice code
- **Solution:** Created examples.py and exercises.py for Lesson 6
- **Status:** Continuing with remaining lessons

### 2. Folder Structure Issue ⚠️ PENDING
- **Issue:** Lesson-6 folder contains nested duplicate path
  - Current: `Lesson-6-If-Else/Phase-2-Control-Flow/Lesson-06-If-Else/`
  - Expected: `Lesson-6-If-Else/` (direct)
- **Action Needed:** Reorganize folder structure

### 3. Missing Documentation ⚠️ PENDING
- Each lesson needs Notes.md files
- Solutions.py files for reference

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Complete Remaining Lessons (This Week)
```
Lesson 7 → Lesson 8 → Lesson 9 → Lesson 10
- Create examples.py for each
- Create exercises.py with 8-10 problems each
- Create solutions.py with annotations
```

### Priority 2: Create Documentation Files
```
- Notes.md for each lesson
- Quick reference guides
- Cheat sheets
```

### Priority 3: Fix Folder Structure
```
- Reorganize Lesson-6 folder
- Standardize naming across all lessons
- Update relative paths if needed
```

### Priority 4: Create Solutions & Reference Material
```
- Quiz answer key
- Capstone project starter code
- Teacher answer keys
```
